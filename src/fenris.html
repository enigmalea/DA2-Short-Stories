    <p>The hunters were after him again.</p>

    <p>
      Truth be told, he'd known for several days. He'd seen it in the eyes of
      the innkeeper, the way the fat man guiltily glanced away and refused to
      meet his gaze. He'd seen it in the pitying look of the whore that stood on
      the corner, and the way she covered it up with a smile. The patrons in
      that squalid tavern where he went to buy his meals grew quiet when he
      entered now, and it was not the uncomfortable silence of human townsfolk
      being confronted with a strange elf covered in strange skin markings and
      carrying a large sword—rather it was the silence of men who knew trouble
      had just walked through the door and were now doing their best to pretend
      it didn't exist. Fenris knew the difference very well.
    </p>

    <p>
      He'd been lazy. Despite the fact that he'd known, still part of him
      refused to admit that it was so. He'd hoped against hope that he was
      wrong, that the signs were simply a fugitive's paranoia. His stay in the
      last three towns had been longer and longer, his efforts to cover up his
      distinctive markings almost nonexistent. He told himself that this was a
      challenge. Let them come. Let them try and take him back, if they dared.
      Deep down, however, he wondered if he hadn't simply grown weary of the
      chase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now was the time. He'd already cleaned his few meager possessions out of
      his room at the inn and jumped out the window. It led to a dark alley in
      the back, with enough ledges below that a quick descent was easily
      accomplished. That was why Fenris had chosen the room after an inspection
      that had the innkeeper staring at him in worry. He almost had to wonder
      how long it would take the fat man before curiosity, or a lack of payment,
      would lead him to check and find Fenris gone. A week, perhaps less if the
      innkeeper was the one who'd sold him out.
    </p>

    <p>
      There was nothing in the alley save for a few lone rats and an elven
      vagrant asleep against a garbage heap. Fenris paused and stared at the man
      in disgust. He'd thought to blend in more once he'd escaped the Imperium.
      In a land where elves were free, certainly one more elf would go
      unnoticed? He'd been a fool, of course. How was he to know that so many of
      his people would squander their freedom living like frightened cattle? If
      his only choices were to either dress as meekly as the local humans
      expected their elves to be, run off to find the wandering clans that
      grubbed in the dirt for whatever scraps the human kingdoms threw them, or
      to fight… then his choice was clear.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vagrant stirred awake as Fenris drew the greatsword from his back. The
      elf squealed in sudden terror but Fenris ignored him. There were others
      coming now, cloaked in the alley's shadows—at least two on either side
      and… one above? He listened, and heard the faintest scraping on the clay
      tiles up above. Yes, no doubt a crossbowman. They thought they had him
      pinned.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fenris launched himself towards the end of the alley that led away from
      the main street. Here it led into a maze of twisty courtyards, sewage and
      lines of hung laundry… but it would be darker there, easier for him to run
      without stirring the town guard. Why the hunters never tried bribing the
      guard to help their hunt he couldn't say. Regardless, he'd run amiss of
      the guard in another town and they'd impeded his efforts to escape as much
      as they impeded the hunters. It wasn't worth the risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vagrant shouted in fear and drunkenly scrambled to his feet, but
      Fenris was already past him. Two long figures approached, barely visible
      but moving fast now as they realized their quarry was aware of the chase.
      Fenris caught a glimpse of maroon. Tevinter soldiers, then. Good, that
      would make this easier. Not that he wouldn't have killed mercenaries just
      as easily, but it was less pleasant than slaughtering dogs like these.
    </p>

    <p>
      A wide arc of his blade knocked the first hunter aside as he parried. The
      second rushed forward, hoping to take advantage of an opening—only to meet
      Fenris's fist. The markings on his skin flashed brightly, the lyrium
      within them sending magic crawling through his flesh, and his fist phased
      through the man's helmet and directly into his head. He lurched to a halt,
      stunned with terror.
    </p>

    <p>So they weren't warned. Fools.</p>

    <p>
      The lyrium markings flashed again as Fenris partially solidified his fist.
      The hunter jolted back, blood gushing forth from his mouth and his ears.
      By now the first hunter was already recovered and swinging his blade.
      Fenris expertly hauled the second around by his head, putting him into the
      path of the swing. The sword chopped deeply into the man's shoulder, and
      with a kick he sent both of them flying together into the brick wall. His
      fist was covered in dark red gore.
    </p>

    <p>
      He would have stayed to finish them off, but the other hunters were
      already figuring things out. A crossbow bolt flew by Fenris's head, barely
      nicking one of his ears, and he could hear the booted feet of more
      soldiers rushing his way. He ran into the alleyway, leaping over the
      hunter who struggled to push off his dead comrade, and sped into the maze.
      Dark doorways flew by as he raced. He cut down clotheslines and tossed
      over barrels to present obstacles behind him. They were definitely giving
      chase—he could hear them swearing in Tevinter, and the crossbowman above
      scrambling to get into position.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first pair of open shutters he saw and Fenris dived through. He landed
      in a kitchen filled with the smell of baking bread, and a human woman
      screamed as he rolled to his feet. No doubt the sight of an elf in
      skintight armor, carrying a blade almost as large as himself, wasn't a
      welcome sight. He got to his feet and noticed the surprisingly comely
      woman, dressed in a nightgown that revealed more of her cleavage than she
      no doubt expected, pressing against the wall.
    </p>

    <p>
      He grinned at her, and she screamed again. So he grabbed a freshly-baked
      loaf off the counter and raced for the front door of the hovel. Already a
      soldier was climbing through the window, causing the woman to scream once
      more and faint dead away. The others would be coming around to the front,
      so he had to get out before…
    </p>

    <p>
      …he stopped cold. He knew the man who stood at the doorway: maroon cloak
      and jet-black hair barely covering those soulless eyes. Not to mention a
      scar on his neck, one that Fenris had put there. Damned healing potions
      and their foul magic. Why couldn't anyone stay dead?
    </p>

    <p>
      "<em>Avanna</em>, Fenris. Good to see you again." The hunter's voice was a
      cold purr as he raised his crossbow and pointed the bolt at Fenris's
      chest. The one on the roof, then. Clever.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Considering what happened last time, I'm surprised you decided to try
      again."
    </p>

    <p>
      "It's not just about the coin any longer, slave." Oh, how Fenris loved it
      when they said that. "Not afraid you'll lose your head for good?"
    </p>

    <p>
      "Not when we have the drop on you. You've become careless. Time to give
      yourself up." The other hunter had made it through the window, and he
      could hear others shouting in the street. He supposed that he really had
      only two choices: give up and hope for a chance to escape later… or take
      his chances.
    </p>

    <p>
      It wasn't really a choice. He tightened his grip on the hilt of his blade
      and smiled at the hunter, slow and deadly.
    </p>

    <p>"<em>Vishante kaffar</em>," he hissed. And he attacked.</p>
